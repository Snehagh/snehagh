## 🧠 ML Engineer | Medical Imaging & Multimodal AI

I am a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in medical imaging and multimodal deep learning systems.  
My work focuses on designing 3D convolutional neural networks, integrating structured clinical features with imaging data, and building reproducible research pipelines in PyTorch.

I’m particularly interested in developing AI systems that bridge imaging data and real-world clinical variables to support better diagnostic and prognostic decision-making.
